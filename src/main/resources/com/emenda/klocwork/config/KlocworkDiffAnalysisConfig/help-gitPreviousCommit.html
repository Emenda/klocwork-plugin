<div>
  When using diffType:'git' it is mandatory to specify the commit with which to perform a git diff with. You can use ${GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT} or manually specify a specific GIT commit hash value.

  The change list between the current commit and the specified previous commit will then be added to the diff file list for Klocwork to process by automatically calling "git diff <previous_commit>" during the build.
