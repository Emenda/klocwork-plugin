    <h2>Full integration analysis build failure conditions (Full)</h2>
    <p>
        Create multiple build failure conditions by using queries that are sent to the Klocwork Server
        through the Web API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Filter issues based on the search query, then provide the status to set the
        build to, along with the threshold (the number of issues to meet this criteria).
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: unless specified, the query runs with issue grouping turned off (grouping:off).
    </p>
