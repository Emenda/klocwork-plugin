  Optionally, specify a custom ltoken location. The Klocwork ltoken is used to authenticate with the Klocwork Server.
  The default ltoken location is in the .klocwork directory which is located in the home directory of the user running the process, for example: C:\Users\user_name\.klocwork\ltoken.
  See the Klocwork documentation for more information.
