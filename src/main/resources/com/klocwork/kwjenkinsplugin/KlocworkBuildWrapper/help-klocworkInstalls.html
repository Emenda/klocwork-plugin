  <h2>Klocwork installations</h2>
  <p>
      Note this is a simple piece of functionality intended for a
      "basic" Jenkins setup. If you use other plugins, such as the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Custom+Tools+Plugin">CustomToolsPlugin</a>
      to handle installations, and the PATH for other tools, we recommend
      you skip this and set up the Klocwork PATH as you would your other tools.
  </p>
  <p>
      If you do not use something like the CustomToolsPlugin and do not have the
      Klocwork PATH configured already...proceed.
  </p>
  <h3>What does this do?</h3>
  <p>
      This adds the provided PATH to the PATH variable for a job.
      Create an installation with a name and reference it on the job under the
      Build Environment settings. If using both the Klocwork Server and CI tools, be careful
      of Unix versus Windows, and use the correct PATH separator (";" instead of ":").
  </p>
  <p>
      For example, if you create an installation called WindowsBuildSlaves, with
      the paths C:\Klocwork\Server\bin;C:\Klocwork\kwciagent\bin
      these will be added to the existing %PATH% variable.
  </p>
  <p>
      The plugin will call /bin/sh or cmd.exe and provide the Klocwork
      executables without a path, so you must ensure that Klocwork is set up
      in your path.
